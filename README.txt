Let your website visitors get in touch with you easily with permanent visible contact informations

== Description ==

Speed Contact Bar enables your visitors to get in contact with you quickly. The plugin shows a colored bar with your contact data and social media URLs on the top of every page of your website. 

The social media icons are included already.

The bar design is responsive and thus ready for smartphones and tablets.

= What you can configure =

There are some options you can set to let the contact bar fit to your needs. You can set 

1. your contact data,
2. URLs to your social media pages and profiles and
3. design options like colors

= Configuration options in detail =

You can show these three **personal contact data**:

1. Headline, also used as call to action

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does the plugin need to work fine? =

Speed Contact bar requires a WordPress installation version equal or greater than 3.4.

= I am loggend in as administrator. Why do I not see the contact bar? =

The most likely reason is the **WordPress Admin Bar fixed on top of the page**. In this case it overlaps the Speed Contact Bar. 

**How to solve this problem?** Just call your website in another browser and do not log in with that browser as a WordPress administrator.

Please write your request in the plugin's [support forum at wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/speed-contact-bar). We will try to take a look and answer as soon as possible.

= I want to switch of the contact bar for a while without losing all settings. How? =

Just deactivate the plugin. The contact bar does not appear and all your data keep stored. If you activate the plugin again you see the contact bar with the last stored settings.

If you deactivate and delete the plugin on the plugins page all files and your settings will be deleted residue-free.

= How can I get the contact bar in my language? =

Translations are available in English and German. If you want to see another language it would be great if you would provide the translation.
