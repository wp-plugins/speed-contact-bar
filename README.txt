Let your website visitors get in touch with you easily with permanent visible contact informations

== Description ==

= Quick contact to you =

Speed Contact Bar enables your visitors to get in contact with you quickly. The plugin shows a colored bar with your contact data and social media URLs on the top of every page of your website. 

The bar design is responsive and thus ready for smartphones and tablets. The social media icons are included already.

Each icon appears if you set its target URL in the option page. The phone icons and numbers are clickable to trigger a phone call. The e-mail is clickable to open a mail client.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does the plugin need to work fine? =

Speed Contact bar requires a WordPress installation version equal or higher than 3.5.

= I am logged in as administrator. Why do I not see the contact bar? =

The most likely reason is the **WordPress Admin Bar fixed on top of the page**. In this case it overlaps the Speed Contact Bar.

You have two possibilities to see the bar:

1. Go to your user profile in the backend a deactivate the checkbox at "Show admin bar"
2. Use another browser, as unlogged visitor

= I want to display this and that. How can I add it? =

Please write your request in the plugin's [support forum at wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/speed-contact-bar). We will try to take a look and answer as soon as possible.

= I want to switch off the contact bar for a while without losing all settings. How? =

Just deactivate the plugin. The contact bar does not appear and all your data are kept stored. If you activate the plugin again you see the contact bar with the last stored settings.

If you deactivate and delete the plugin on the plugins page all files and settings of the contact bar will be deleted residue-free.

= How can I get the contact bar in my language? =

Translations are available in English and German. If you want to see another language it would be great if you would provide the translation.
